<h1 id="evolutionary-systems">Evolutionary Systems</h1>
<p>There have been more than four decades of computational systems inspired by natural evolution. It has become a major field of machine learning and optimization. Beyond AI, it has been used in hardware and circuit design, robotics, and more recently in industrial design and architecture. It has of course also been deeply explored in art and music.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.karlsims.com/papers/ksf11.gif" alt="Karl Sims"></p>
<h2 id="natural-evolution">Natural evolution</h2>
<p>The theory of <strong>natural evolution</strong> combines <strong>population, diversity, heredity and selection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evolution requires a <strong>population</strong> of individuals </li>
<li>that exhibit <strong>diversity</strong> (both similarities and variations between each other, both within and between species). </li>
<li>These individuals can produce new individuals; offspring that exhibit similarites with the parent(s) through <strong>heredity</strong>. </li>
<li>However not all of the population can successfully reproduce. Any factor that affects the possibility of an individual reproducing, thus also affects what characteristics are inherited in the population as a whole. Charles Darwin&#39;s theory of natural <strong>selection</strong>, proposed in 1859, is that the section of the population that can reproduce is not entirely random, but rather is regulated by interactions between inherited characteristics and environmental constraints (such as available food, populations of symbionts, predators and parasites, and so on). </li>
<li>Accordingly, the characteristics of a species may change over time (<strong>evolution</strong>), forming a history that can be investigated through the fossil records.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="img/origin_of_the_species.jpg" alt="Origin of the Species"></p>
<h3 id="genetics-and-the-modern-synthesis">Genetics and the modern synthesis</h3>
<p>In 1865 Mendel proposed that characteristics are transmitted to offspring through particles of matter (which we now call <strong>genetic material</strong>). Schroedinger conjectured that these materials must be aperiodic crystals, and the actual structure of DNA was identified several years later. The <em>&quot;modern synthesis&quot;</em> in biology today has integrated genetics with natural evolution, through the interaction of genotypes and phenotypes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>genotype</strong> is the genetic material that is transmitted during reproduction. It encodes information that tends not to change during a lifetime. <ul>
<li>The creation or variation of new heritable characteristics operates mainly at the genotypic level. Genetic variation can occur during replication of the genome, such as copying-error <em>mutations</em> (reversals of segments, insertion &amp; removal of segments, changing individual elements in the sequence, and pair-wise substitution over whole sections) and <em>recombination</em> (taking sections from two different parent genes to construct a new child gene). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>phenotype</strong> is a physical and dynamic living organism in a population. It is the manifestation of the genotype: different genotypes lead to different phenotypic variations, or even different species. <ul>
<li>Natural selection mainly operates at the phenotypic level, as organisms interact with their enviornment (including other organisms).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence the modern synthesis requires not only a model for <em>how <strong>variation</strong> is introduced</em>, but also <em>how genetic material is transfered</em> (<strong>inheritance</strong>) and <em>how the phenotype emerges from the genotype</em> (<strong>development</strong>), and what other roles it plays. It is increasingly being understood how the complexity of the environment and materials of life are likely as much or more responsible for the variety of life than the genes themselves.</p>
<p><img src="img/transcription.jpg" alt="Rendering"></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFCvkkDSfIU">The current theory of cell replication and DNA transcription been beautifully illustrated by Drew Berry</a>; and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKW4F0Nu-UY&amp;list=PL3DB3C131CBCD2A0F&amp;index=5">more of his animations here</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Briefly: a biological cell contains a vast array of different proteins, whose concentrations determine structures and behaviors of the cell. The proteins are specifed by information in the DNA genetic material (grouped physically into <strong>chromosomes</strong>). When a cell reproduces by <strong>mitosis</strong>, a copy of the DNA is made in the new cell. The sections of a DNA chromosome that code for behavior are called <strong>genes</strong>. These regions are constantly being <strong>transcribed</strong>, producing a specific RNA strand for each coding gene region which is in turn used to produce a specific protein; the protein string immediately folds up (in a way we cannot yet simulate) into a particular reactive shape which specifies the protein&#39;s behavioral role in the cell. This is a one-directional flow of information: Coding DNA -&gt; RNA -&gt; folding -&gt; active protein. In addition to coding regions genes may also have  <strong>regulatory region</strong> which can react with specific proteins to activate or inhibit the coding-protein system, forming a complex <strong>regulatory network</strong> of interactions by which one gene can activate or inhibit another, and also specify changes of behavior of a cell according to environmental conditions such as chemical signals. These networks can be fantastically complex even in very simple organisms, according to the scientific results of <strong>functional genomics</strong>. Between the coding and regulatory regions of DNA, there are huge sections of <strong>nongenic</strong> DNA, whose role (or lack thereof) is not yet understood.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="artificial-evolution">Artificial evolution</h2>
<p>Artificial evolution is a form of computational simulation whose process emulates the abstract structure of natural evolution. Broadly it comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>population of phenotypes</strong>, as finite individuals of properties &amp; behaviours</li>
<li>A representation of <strong>genotypes</strong>; each individual carries a specific &quot;genotype&quot;</li>
<li>A mechanism of <strong>selection</strong> to identify which phenotypes may reproduce; i.e. a mechanism to evaluate the fitness (or viability) of phenotypes.</li>
<li>A mechanism of <strong>heredity</strong> to preserve genetic information between generations</li>
<li>Mechanisms to introduce <strong>variation</strong> to genotypes</li>
<li>A <strong>development</strong> mechanism to produce phenotypes from genotypes</li>
</ul>
<p>The system is then run by these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initialization</strong> of a &#39;seed&#39; population of genotypes</li>
<li><strong>Development</strong> of phenotypes from the genotypes </li>
<li>Evaluation and <strong>selection</strong> of best/viable candidates of phenotypes, according to fitness criteria or ongong viability conditions, to choose who may reproduce.</li>
<li><strong>Reproduction</strong>, creating new genotypes by applying mechanisms of variation, according to variation rates/probabilities.</li>
<li>Repeat from step (2) or terminate if a terminating condition is satisfied (such as sufficient fitness). </li>
</ol>
<p>Steps 2-5 may be run in lock-step, or asynchronously with overlapping individual life-spans.</p>
<p>The main systematic differences between this an natural evolution are that the underlying mechanisms specified by us in advance, as are the initial populations and the method of selection and/or environmental conditions. Further, that we can stop and start, copy and replay etc. this process at will. And of course, artificial evolution occurs in a far far simpler substrate than biology!</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-arithmetic-genetic-algorithm">A simple arithmetic genetic algorithm</h2>
<p>As a simple starting point, let&#39;s consider the space of <em>simple arithmetic</em> as our environment. Arithmietic is a good, non-trivial space because a) there are many ways to arrive at a solution, and b) there are many cases where the solution isn&#39;t obvious at the outset. It is also good, because arithmetic statements can be constructed from a very simple alphabet of terms: </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> dictionary = [<span class="hljs-string">&quot;+&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;-&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;*&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;/&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;1&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;2&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;3&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;4&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;5&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;6&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;7&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;8&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;9&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;0&quot;</span>];</code></pre>
<p>The selection criterion can be how effectively an arithmetic expression computes a desired target number. To make things interesting, let&#39;s make the target an <em>irrational</em> number, such as the value of PI:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> target = <span class="hljs-built_in">Math</span>.PI;</code></pre>
<p>Our genotype will be a list of integers (whole numbers) that can map to the dictionary:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">genotype</span>(<span class="hljs-params">size</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-comment">// initialize:</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> geno = [];
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> i=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; size; i++) {
    geno[i] = <span class="hljs-built_in">random</span>(dictionary.length);
  }
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> geno;
}</code></pre>
<p>The development process, producing a phenotype from a genotype, will convert these symbols into Javascript code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">develop</span>(<span class="hljs-params">genotype</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-comment">// convert gene values to a list of symbols:</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> list = genotype.map(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">idx</span>) </span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> dictionary[idx] });
  <span class="hljs-comment">// convert the array of symbols to a string of code:</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> code = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;return &quot;</span> + list.join(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;&quot;</span>);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> code;
}</code></pre>
<p>The chances are, the generated code is garbage, and might well throw an error. We can wrap it in a <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> block to handle that case. It also might return a meaningless result such as <code>Infinity</code> or <code>NaN</code>, which we can detect using <code>isFinite()</code>. In both cases, the fitness should be zero.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we can measure a fitness according to how close the result is to our target. To get a value between 0 (least fit) to 1 (most fit), we can apply a <code>1 / (1+n)</code> operation, where n is the absolute difference to the target:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">evaluate</span>(<span class="hljs-params">code</span>) </span>{
   <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span> {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// convert to an executable function:</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> f = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Function</span>(code);
        <span class="hljs-comment">// run it to get the result</span>
        <span class="hljs-comment">// if this throws an error, it jumps to the catch() below</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> result = f();
        <span class="hljs-comment">// fitness is zero for Infinite or NaN results:</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!<span class="hljs-built_in">isFinite</span>(result)) {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
        }
        <span class="hljs-comment">// otherwise, compute fitness </span>
        <span class="hljs-comment">//according to how near it is to the target:</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span> / (<span class="hljs-number">1</span> + (<span class="hljs-built_in">Math</span>.abs(result - target)));
   } <span class="hljs-keyword">catch</span>(e) {
           <span class="hljs-comment">// fitness is zero if it threw an error:</span>
           <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
   }
}</code></pre>
<p>This gives us all the basic components we need to generate a random population as genotypes. We already know how to develop and evaluate such a genotype, and storing several in a population:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  pop = [];
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; pop_size; i++) {
    pop.push({
      <span class="hljs-attr">geno</span>: genotype(<span class="hljs-number">20</span>)
      <span class="hljs-attr">pheno</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>,
      <span class="hljs-attr">fitness</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
    });
  }

  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> a <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> pop) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// develop genotype</span>
    a.pheno = develop(a.geno)
    <span class="hljs-comment">// evaluate fitness</span>
    a.fitness = evaluate(a.pheno)
  }</code></pre>
<p>It is generally useful to sort a population by fitness, which can be done like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// sort the population by comparing pairs</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// as a result, the fittest candidate will be in population[0]</span>
pop.sort(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">a, b</span>) </span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> b.fitness - a.fitness; });</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>After sorting it is convenient to print out the candidates, their fitness, etc, so we can see how the evolution proceeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After evaluating, we create a new generation of candidates, broadly derived from the previous, but with fitter candidates being more likely to be progenitors. The simplest method is to pick a parent at random, but biasing toward the lower indices. (A simple trick to do this is for the nth child to use a the parent at index <code>random(n)</code>.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is called <em>stochastic universal sampling</em>: it draws samples from the entire range, but selects fitter individuals more often than less-fit candidates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must also introduce some variation (mutations) while generating new genotypes at this point. The simplest method is to introduce a branch with a predetermined probability to randomize a gene rather than copy from the parent, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"> <span class="hljs-comment">// copy or mutate genes:</span>
 <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> j = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; j &lt; parent.length; j++) {
   <span class="hljs-comment">// mutate?</span>
   <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-built_in">random</span>() &lt; mutability) {
     child[j] = <span class="hljs-built_in">random</span>(dictionary.length); 
   } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
     <span class="hljs-comment">// copy:</span>
     child[j] = parent[j];
   }

<h3 id="visualizing-the-evolution">Visualizing the evolution</h3>
<p>With this in play, we might already see some clear evolutionary behaviour.  </p>
<p>But it&#39;s hard to see what&#39;s actually going on, with so many individuals flying by on each frame. To make sense of what&#39;s going on, we can introduce some statistical graphing. We can divide up the canvas into quadrants using <code>draw2D.push().scale(0.5).translate(x, y)</code> and <code>draw2D.pop()</code>, which will make it easier to separate graphs. Let&#39;s graph the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bar graph of the fitness of each individual<ul>
<li>We can compute a width (1/population.length) and loop over each individual, placing a <code>draw2D.rect()</code> according to the individual fitness. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A colour chart of the genetic data of each individual<ul>
<li>We can use a nested loop, first over indidviduals as above, and then over an individual&#39;s genes, mapping the gene values to hue via <code>draw2D.hsl()</code> and placing an appropriate <code>draw2D.rect()</code>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A graph of the evolving fitness over generations, including peak, mean, and standard deviation.<ul>
<li>To do this we&#39;ll have to keep track of data over the last N generations. This can be a list that is appended to after each generation, storing the information we need. To compute the mean fitness, take the average of all individuals&#39; fitnesses. To compute the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">standard deviation</a>, we use the square root of the average of the square of the individual&#39;s fitness difference from the mean (see below). We can then graph the peak and mean as points, and the standard deviation as &#39;error bars&#39; around the mean.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-comment">// compute mean fitness:</span>

<h3 id="observations">Observations</h3>
<p>Armed with these statistical data-visualization perspectives, and by observing the behaviour, what insights can you draw, and what ideas have you for improving it?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You may notice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium">punctuated equilibria</a>. Run the simulation many times (hit enter), and you may notice that the fittest candidate is not always converging to the same result. There are clearly multiple distant fitness peaks here. Does it sometimes seem to get stuck? Can you suggest why? Can you think of any way to modify the mutation, evaluation, or even the genetic representation to overcome this?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try changing the genome size, the population size, and the mutation rates, to see how it changes. </p>
<ul>
<li>The mutation rate acts a bit like a temperature control -- too high and good results can&#39;t remain viable, too low and it takes to long to get anywhere. This is a <strong>meta-parameter</strong>, not part of the evolution itself, but has a strong effect on it. Maybe let your mouse control it to &#39;perform&#39; the evolution?</li>
<li>Larger populations help to generate more chances of leaping off a local peak. Too short genome sizes can be a tough challenge, but too long genomes make it less likely to find a result quickly -- and add more noise. Is there a way to make genome size variable, and give shorter results higher fitness? What other mutation methods could help? What other developmental models could be tried? Is there a better way to pick parents?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You may notice that the code generated sometimes looks odd -- and that the evolution has discovered tricks such as adding numbers multiplied by zero, prefixing zeroes to numbers, and even placing two slashes to create a comment (followed by &quot;junk DNA&quot;), in order to get a result with the specific gene length. (You might even see block comments like <code>/*7493*/</code>!) We could easily prevent this by turning our <code>&quot;/&quot;</code> symbol into a <code>&quot; / &quot;</code> symbol, but perhaps there is an advantage not to? Even when a stable result is found, the content behind the <code>//</code> commments continues to change.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Try changing the symbol list. What happens if you reduce the set of numbers (e.g. only even or odd)? What happens if you add the &quot;.&quot; character? How about &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot;?</li>
<li>How would you be able to add operators such as <code>Math.sin()</code>?  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Can you think of a way to allow different genome sizes? Can we factor in shorter genomes as a positive fitness trait?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, computing Pi is a &#39;toy problem&#39;, and not especially useful other than in revealing certain characteristics of artificial evolution, but the genetic algorithm can be applied to much more interesting and useful problems. What other problems could you imagine using it for? More generally, what kinds of problems might this method suited for? What kinds of problems might it not?</p>
<p>The genetic algorithm as presented here is one of the simplest kinds of artificial evolution; we can look at different approaches to each of its aspects, such as genetic representation, variation, selection, etc. </p>
<hr>
<h2 id="selection">Selection</h2>
<p><strong>For problem solving in data mining, engineering, design, architecture, etc.</strong>: If the fitness criterion is static and designed around a particular problem we wish to find a solution for, evolution can help evaluate &amp; test candidate solutions and selectively breed them to produce better solutions, ideally converging on an optimal one, without having to understand or derive by proof. It is a form of optimization. However this process may take a long time or a lot of processing power to find a satisfactory result, or may not reach a result at all. Not all problems are suitable for evolutionary search.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that simply taking the best candidate alone is not necessarily the ideal strategy; selecting randomly by proportion to fitness (&quot;roulette wheel&quot; selection) may better overcome local maxima. However many systems use a different form of selection known as <strong>tournament selection</strong>, in which a number of individuals are chosen at random from the population to create a temporary neighbourhood set, and a fitness-skewed selection is made from that set. In part this helps to mirror the spatial/network effects of populations, in that it is unlikely for every member of a population to meet every other; selection is made on the somewhat random subset of the population that is encountered. Selection pressure is easily adjusted by changing the tournament neighbourhood set size. <a href="http://codepen.io/grrrwaaa/pen/zrLZvK?editors=001">Here&#39;s the Pi hunting example modified to use probabilistic tournament selection</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidently, these systems differ markedly from natural evolution by having a static measure, and thus a singular teleological character, a meaningful sense of progress, across the entire history of the system. This is a pragatic approach, and highly artificial: there is no absolute or static fitness function in biology.</p>
<p><strong>For art, music, and other less formalized domains</strong> we may need to consider other methods of selection, since a formal measure may not be possible, or the problem may not be clearly statable in advance. E.g. can we measure aesthetic quality in formal terms?</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive selection. Pioneered by Dawkins&#39; Biomorphs (see below) and Karl Sims&#39; evolved images, in which several candidates are presented to human observers, who apply the selection manually. Also known as <strong>aesthetic selection</strong>. It is more like <strong>selective breeding</strong> than natural evolution. <ul>
<li>Examples of aesthetic selection from previous classes:<ul>

<li><a href="http://codepen.io/grrrwaaa/pen/vXqWwj?editors=0010">Strange Attractor by Rose Zhou</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A problem here is that the human becomes the bottleneck of evolution, constraining population sizes and rates of evolution to very small scales. <ul>
<li>Opening up the system to online interaction is one way to scale a system to the massive numbers of generations needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It may also tend toward selecting for the aesthetic average rather than the remarkable; or toward the human-centric rather than the abstract. See <a href="http://picbreeder.org">Picbreeder</a> for a current variation on Karl Sims&#39; idea. What do you notice about the highly-ranked images?</li>
<li>An interesting variation, which might reduce these problems, is to make the selection continuous and implicit. <a href="http://jonmccormack.info/artworks/eden/">Jon McCormack&#39;s Eden</a> measured fitness globally according to how long gallery visitors remained in front of a particular evolving sub-population.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evolved/evolving selection. First evolve a population of artificial art critics, trained from human-evaluated examples, and then use these to apply selection criteria to a population of candidate artworks. Some projects have also proposed a form where one population represents the candidate products, and the other population represents artificial critics.</li>
<li>A viability-oriented form of artificial evolution may be used for more theoretical and aesthetic branches of artificial life research. The viability measure arises as an emergent property of underlying complexity of the world, such as the requirement to maintain energetic/metabolic balance or to maintain structural integrity, as well as the collective effects of multiple species and non-living dynamics within the environment. For this reason it is sometimes referred to as <strong>ecosystemic selection</strong>. <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-78761-7_42">See discussion here</a>. This may still incorporate indirect interaction from human agents if desired.</li>

<h2 id="aesthetic-selection-of-biomorphs">Aesthetic selection of Biomorphs</h2>
<p>Biomorphs are virtual entities that were devised by Richard Dawkins in his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker">The Blind Watchmaker</a> as a way to visualize the power of evolutionary processes. Dawkins used a simple symbolic rendering of lines at limited angles, grown in a kind of tree structure, as his phenotypes. Of a given generation, he selected the biomorph he found most aesthetically pleasing, making this the parent of the next generation.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/BiomorphBounce.png" alt="biomorph"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adding new lines (or removing them) based on simple developmental rules offered a discrete set of possible new shapes (mutations), which were displayed on screen so that the user could choose between them. The chosen mutation would then be the basis for another generation of biomorph mutants to be chosen from, and so on. Thus, the user, by selection, could steer the evolution of biomorphs. This process often produced images which were reminiscent of real organisms for instance beetles, bats, or trees. Dawkins speculated that the unnatural selection role played by the user in this program could be replaced by a more natural agent if, for example, colourful biomorphs could be selected by butterflies or other insects, via a touch sensitive display set up in a garden.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.mountimprobable.com">Check out this biomorphs recreation online!</a></p>
<p>One of the simplest ways to create a biomorph is to interpret strings as instructions for another program. The genotype is a string of symbols, the phenotype is the graphics that result. The classic example is using them as instructions for a &quot;turtle graphics&quot; interpreter. </p>
<h3 id="aside-turtle-graphics">Aside: Turtle graphics</h3>
<p>We&#39;d like to generate biomorphs in a similar way. The biomorphs are all made out of simple line drawings. For efficiency, we can use the <code>draw2D.lines()</code> method to draw a list of lines at once. Here&#39;s how it works:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// draws a plus (two pairs of points for each line)</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">draw2D</span>.lines([
    [<span class="hljs-number">0.2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>], [<span class="hljs-number">0.8</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>], <span class="hljs-comment">// the horizontal line</span>

]);</code></pre>
<p>To draw in the Turtle style, we need to represent a turtle&#39;s properties, which are a position and a direction. Then, we can manipulate these properties to capture the turtle&#39;s movement, collecting points of a line as it moves. We can start by building a function that creates a turtle, and uses it to collect points to draw a specific shape, such as a square.</p>

<p>Note: We have to be careful to insert copies of the turtle location (via <code>.clone()</code>) into the list of line points. If we didn&#39;t clone a copy of the point, we would end up with many references to the same <code>vec2</code> object in the list.</p>

<p>It should be apparent that the code is highly repetitive. Conceptually, we could instead represent this as a data structure: a list of commands such as &quot;forward, turn, forward, turn, forward, turn, forward&quot;.

<p>Now our code is not only shorter, it is far more powerful: it allows us to generate different shapes in a data-driven way, simply by passing in a different list of <strong>commands</strong>. It may already be tempting to think of what other commands we could add to this interpreter&#39;s capabilities.</p>
<p>With this in place, we could now expand our vocabulary of actions in our mini-language. Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>.</strong>: do nothing</li>
<li><strong>f</strong>: move forward half a unit, drawing a line</li>
<li><strong>&gt;</strong>: turn a different amount to the left</li>
<li><strong>&lt;</strong>: turn a different amount to the right</li>
<li><strong>/</strong>: reduce the rotation angle in the current turtle</li>
<li><strong>\</strong>: increase the rotation angle in the current turtle </li>
</ul>
<p>We could also make our shapes more dynamic. For example, we could generate rotation angles in the function according to the current time (e.g. <code>let a = Math.sin(now)</code>). </p>
<p>Turtle graphics can also create <em>fractals</em>, that is, objects with partial symmetries. One way of doing this is rather similar to how we created graphics state stacks with <code>draw2D.push()</code> and <code>pop()</code>: duplicating the current renderer for a sequence of operations, then returning to the prior coordinate space. With turtles being the renderer, can you imagine how to do these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(</strong>: &quot;push&quot;: spawn a clone of the turtle and continue interpreting</li>
<li><strong>)</strong>: &quot;pop&quot;: stop interpreting with the current turtle and return to its parent turtle</li>
<li><strong>=</strong>: spawn a clone facing the opposite direction (for symmetry)</li>
<li><strong>|</strong>: spawn a clone with reversed chirality (for symmetry)</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Bearing in mind what we learned with the math solver, we could go one step further and turn the interpreter a <strong>compiler</strong>; a compiler is just an interpreter that <em>generates executable code</em> rather than <em>executes code</em>. We can take our interpreter and change all of its actions into the generation of strings of code, collecting all these lines of code into a big list. Finally, we join all those strings together (with newlines and/or semicolons) and convert them into a <code>new Function</code> as before. And, rather than building strings directly, we could select operators using numbers. With this we can take any arbitrary list of numbers and turn it into a re-usable graphics function! Here&#39;s an example of how this might look:</p>

<p>Since turtle graphics are generated from strings, they can be generated from string genomes! That is, we can create genotype strings as instructions for a &quot;turtle graphics&quot; interpreter to draw biomorph shapes. Which is therefore a function that maps genome strings into phenotypes, or into functions that create genotypes -- that is, the interpreter/compiler is the <strong>development</strong> component of artifiical evolution. </p>
<p>But first we need a population, and a method to generate random candidates of this population. </p>
<p>And, we need a way to show all the population members side-by-side or in a grid. We can re-use the <code>draw2D.push()</code> method to set up a grid of coordinate-frames per biomorph. If we have 16 candidates we can arrange in a 4x4 grid, using a simple method to convert population index to grid row/column and vice versa:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-comment">// get number of columns/rows from population size:</span>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember: although we have used this method to direct a Turtle-renderer, there&#39;s no reason why the same method can be used by a very different kind of interpreter to produce a completely different paradigm of phenotypes! It could be producing forms by diffusion-limited aggregation, or voxel painting, or by directing the forces of a vehicle. It could be specifying the layout of an audio synthesizer patch or instructions for a 3D printer, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="variation">Variation</h2>
<p>The mechanisms of variation possible partly depend on the representation chosen. But one of the advantages of using lists (of symbols or numbers or genetic codes) as genotypes is the flexibility to perform many different kinds of mutations. The most common methods of variation in artificial evolution are also naturally inspired.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Random <strong>mutation</strong>; akin to errors copying DNA. For example, a parent &quot;dog&quot; could produce children such as &quot;fog&quot;, &quot;dig&quot;, and so on. Obviously some mutations will not create viable individuals.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the genome is represented as a symbol string, then random locations in the string may be replaced by new random characters. </li>
<li>If the genome is represented as a string of finite and bounded integers, then elements could be &#39;nudged&#39; (+1 or -1), randomized, or inverted</li>
<li>If the genome is represented as a string of unbounded numbers, then randomly signed deviations on a power spectrum of magnitudes might be considered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fragment <strong>recombination</strong> through a variety of operators (most of which are also seen in DNA):</p>
<ul>
<li>repeat a character or substring (repetition: &quot;dooog&quot;), </li>
<li>insert a random character (random: &quot;doge&quot;), </li>
<li>delete a randomly chosen substring (&quot;do&quot;), </li>
<li>split the string in two sections and join them the other way around</li>
<li>more general forms of cut/copy &amp; paste/insert of substrings (&quot;dodo&quot;, &quot;ogod&quot;), -- see <code>Array.splice</code></li>
<li>reverse of a substring (&quot;god&quot;), -- see <code>Array.reverse</code></li>
<li>shuffle a substring</li>
<li>etc. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly many of these mutations can change the length of the string. It may be desired to add limits on the minimum or maximum length of the string mutations can produce; or it may be desired to penalize the fitness of long strings. It is worth noting that within a biological species, DNA lengths tend to be the same, but between species there is a lot of variance in length (and not particularly correlated with the size, complexity, or evolutionary age of a species). </p>
<ul>
<li>Sexual <strong>cross-over</strong>: akin to sexual reproduction in biology. As a binary string, the child takes the first fraction from one parent, and the remainder from the other. For example, breeding the strings &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;cat&quot; could generate children such as &quot;dot&quot;, &quot;dat&quot;, and &quot;cog&quot;. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Why use reproduction for evolution? The main reason seems to be that crossover helps maintain diversity in the population. In the face of an unpredictable environment, we cannot know which strategy will be best; we can try small variations, and hedge our bets by making very many of them (population diversity). Unpredictibility of the world implies that what was true today may not be tomorrow, so the flexibility to avoid timeless commitment is also a good strategy; but the inheritance of choices is a useful option when the environment retains some stability. Asexual reproduction (cloning) can adapt to a habitat more explosively but also leads to more homogenous populations subject to catastrophic collapses as the enviornmental conditions change. Moreover, crossover may introduce more interesting variants than point-wise mutation alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="variation-rates">Variation Rates</h3>
<p>As with temperature-like parameters we saw in CA, a crucial factor in evolution is the rate or probability of variation. Too much, and the population may never significantly diverge from a randomly initialized one; too little, and it may find itself stuck on the first solution it finds, with a largely homogenous population. It may be wise to have different mutation rates for mutation and recombination, for different members of a population, by fitness rank etc. Perhaps these rates can also be evolved (&quot;meta-evolution&quot;). Perhaps mutation rates should reduce over time unless the population appears to be stagnating. (See also <em>simulated annealing</em>.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Variation may also vary per gene. Looking again at biology, we see that DNA contains certain sections that seem to be more prone to mutation than others; a gene&#39;s mutation rate itself may be an evolved/inherited characteristic. Similarly there are so-called &#39;jumping genes&#39;, genetic substrings that are far more likely to move location within the DNA than others. Perhaps they are functional in many locations, and can serve many purposes. In both cases, it is suggestive to consider having some kinds of markers for substrings that indicate how likely a form of mutation is at this point. How would you attempt to do this?</p>

<h2 id="neuro-evolution">Neuro-Evolution</h2>
<p>Neuro-evolution means using evolutionary algorithms to evolve neural networks.</p>
<h3 id="quick-primer-on-neural-networks">Quick primer on neural networks</h3>
<p>A simple neural network consists of three kinds of neurons connected together:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input neurons</strong>: whose activation level is determined by external data, such as sensors in an environment, pixels in an image, characters of a string, etc. These neurons have only output connections.</li>
<li><strong>Output neurons</strong>: whose activation levels <em>cause</em> effects, whether this is decision making or discrinating between categories (e.g. picking the output with the highest activation), or whether it is controls for an agent (such as choices of movement patterns of an NPC in a videogame). These neurons have only input connections.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden neurons</strong>: these neurons sit between input and output neurons, with no direct connection to the external world. They may be arranged in layers or be more flexibly arranged. These neurons will have input connections and output connections. A &quot;deep&quot; neural network is one with many layers of hidden neurons.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Colored_neural_network.svg/560px-Colored_neural_network.svg.png" alt="nn"></p>
<p>Neurons with input connections (hidden and output neurons) compute their activation level by summing a vector of <strong>weights</strong> cross multiplied with the inputs, plus a <strong>bias</strong> term, and then feeding this through an <strong>activation function</strong> (such as a sigmoid curve). For example, if a neuron has 3 inputs, this means:</p>

<p>The weights (<code>w1, w2, w3</code>) indicate the relative importance of the inputs they are connected to. They could be zero (meaning no importance), positive (indicating a correlative relationship), or negative (meaning an inverse relationship).

<p>The <code>sigmoid</code> function ensures that output is always bounded between 0.0 and 1.0, regardless the input. It is a smooth mapping from continous space to a bounded space, that approximates binary logic at the extremes. </p>

<p>So, for a specific problem, we need to know </p>
<ol>
<li>what the input parameters will be (i.e. the input neurons) -- and these should be normalized to a range of 0..1,</li>
<li>what the output parameters will be (i.e. the output neurons) -- and how to interpret them,</li>
<li>we need to decide how many hidden neurons to have,</li>
<li>how to connect them all,</li>
<li>and how to set the weights and biases for all the hidden &amp; output neurons.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two steps are usually somewhat evident from the problem at hand. E.g. if the task is to play a videogame, then the inputs would be environmental features nearby the player, and the outputs would be actions to press buttons etc. on the controller. For step 3, in many cases a fixed number of hidden layers/neurons is decided in advance (this is a &quot;hyperparameter&quot; of the system), and a common strategy is taken for step 4, such as connecting all nodes in one layer to all nodes in the previous layer, or to connect to a fixed number of neurons in the previous layer (both of which makes it convenient to represent weights and biases as a matrix). There isn&#39;t a general easy way to know what is the right layout and connectivity in advance, it&#39;s a bit of heuristics and trial and error.</p>
<p>Before getting to step 5, let&#39;s build a working neural network, and visualize the results to get an idea of what is happening. In the following example we use a simple list of numbers for the bias and weights of each neuron in turn:</p>
<p class="codepen" data-height="520" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="grrrwaaa" data-slug-hash="ExyeWxj" data-preview="true"><span><a href="https://codepen.io/grrrwaaa/pen/ExyeWxj">Open pen.</a></span></p><script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<p>The primary focus of machine learning with neural networks is deriving the weights and biases of a network that perform well in a specific problem domain. This usually involves running many generations or simulations of the network in its environment, and adjusting the weights and biases gradually to improve their performance. In <strong>supervised learning</strong>, we measure the success of a network&#39;s prediction against a training set of data of known inputs and outputs. One method to do this is called <strong>back-propagation</strong>, which involves taking the error in the output and propagating that error back through the network, using the derivative of the activation function and the weights etc., to adjust the weights of the network in a way that would reduce the error. Sometimes however a training set of data isn&#39;t available, but rather an overall <strong>cost</strong> can be measured of a neural network&#39;s performance in an environment; this kind of <strong>unsupervised</strong> learning can be effective for estimation problems. But some problems are even more complex: it may be that the error or cost of a neural network can&#39;t be taken at an individual step. For example, developing a winning strategy for a video game is only known after many steps have been taken. In these situations we can use <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>, which aims to minimize long-term &quot;cost&quot;, balancing exploration for new knowledge and exploitation of existing knowledge. </p>
<h3 id="neuro-evolution-1">Neuro-Evolution</h3>
<p>Neuro-evolution uses evolutionary algorithms to develop neural network, in which: </p>
<ul>
<li>the genotype needs to encode the configuration of the neural network: at minimum, the weights and biases of each neuron,</li>
<li>the phenotype is the executable neural network itself, whose fitness function thus depends on how well the neural network performs in the problem domain, </li>
<li>the performance of a neural network among a population determines its fitness for selection of a new generation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Genetic encoding could be a direct encoding of numbers for the specific weights and biases, or could be an indirect encoding that <em>generates</em> the weights and biases programmatically (just as our biomorphs were generated from sequences of steps), which could also specify the network layout and connections.</p>
<h4 id="a-neuro-evolution-game">A neuro-evolution game</h4>
<p>For a problem domain, let&#39;s create a simple multi-agent game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players have a head and a tail. </li>
<li>If an agent&#39;s head touches another&#39;s tail, it puts the other agent out of the game, and gains a point.</li>
<li>Play continues until only one player is left; then a new round begins. </li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly players need a few properties: a head position, a size, a tail position, a velocity, a score, and a flag to mark if they are out of the game. To begin, we can have them do a random walk, by randomly setting velocity on each frame. Updating motion for the head is the same as our simple agent systems as before. But, we have to carefully compute where the tail ends up. We can do this by getting the current head-&gt;tail vector, re-scale it to be the desired length, then addding it to the head position. This creates some interesting dynamics when an agent changes direction and reverses. We can draw the head &amp; tail using push/pop contexts as before.</p>
<p>Next we add collision tests, using nested loops in a similar way as with the flocking systems, being careful not to consider ourselves. We can compute the distance between our tail &amp; the neighbours head to see if a collision occurs. If so, the neighbour gains points, and we remove ourself from play. </p>
<p>So far the game works, but the agents are blind. We can give them a simple sense of vision, e.g. perhaps identifying the nearest head or tail in the world. Again we loop over neighbours (excluding ourselves), now computing the relative vector from our head to their head and tail, being careful to <code>relativewrap()</code> so that neighbours over the world edges are taken into account, and narrowing down to whichever has the least distance to us. To make the senses <strong>egocentric</strong> rather than <strong>allocentric</strong>, we can rotate the relative vector into our coordinate frame (so we could also use field of view limit here too, as with the flockers). It is useful to also plot this relative vector in space to understand what is happening, so we might need to store it in the agent. </p>
<p class="codepen" data-height="520" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="grrrwaaa" data-slug-hash="MWeqBXP" data-preview="true"><span><a href="https://codepen.io/grrrwaaa/pen/MWeqBXP">Open pen.</a></span></p><script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<p>Thus our new sense can identify <em>relative orientation</em>, <em>relative distance</em>, and whether the closest item is a head or a tail. To make these senses more suitable for a neural network we should normalize to 0..1 ranges:</p>
<ul>
<li>For distance, we can use <code>1/(1+distance_squared)</code>, so that the sense becomes more intense as items become very close</li>
<li>For angle, we could perhaps take the cosine (so that intensity is highest with a target in front, and lowest behind), scaling the result from -1..1 to 0..1. Or perhaps try the sine, so that intensities are at the left and right, but not centre. </li>
<li>The third item (whether the nearest item is a head or a tail) can simply be <code>0</code> or <code>1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, we must drive the motion from 0..1 parameters as the outputs of the neural network, post-scaling these as needed to drive angular change and speed.  To test this, we can first feed <code>random()</code> into the movement. Here are a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scale 0..1 by some maximum speed to set the velocity length</li>
<li>Scale 0..1 by a <code>random()</code> to set the amount of &quot;tumble&quot; vs. straight</li>
<li>Or, use two outputs as &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, subtracting one from the other to derive a specific turn angle. </li>
<li>Find out which output neuron is highest, and select an action (&quot;move forward&quot;, &quot;turn left&quot;, &quot;turn right&quot;) accordingly. </li>
</ul>
<p>Again, it is worth storing these <code>inputs</code> and <code>output</code> in the agent so we can visualize them if desired.</p>
<p>Try hard wiring the senses to the outputs in some variants to see what kinds of movements the mappings can generate:</p>
<ul>
<li>try crossing the sensors over to opposite outputs</li>
<li>try inverting some of them (i.e. 1-n)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we are happy that we have a good set of inputs and outputs, we can start adding neural networks. Each agent will have a unique set of weights and biases. The sensor data becomes the first activation layer of the network, and the final activation layer becomes the output that drives action and motion. When this works, we can run the game for a number of frames, then apply a fitness criterion for evolution based on the agent scores, sorting the population accordingly, and using it to generate a new population. Mutation would likely focus on fine or coarse adjustments of weights and biases. </p>

<h4 id="observations-1">Observations</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that we might not see significant fitness improvements after the first few generations. Why? Since their environment is entirely defined by the population, than any successful strategy will quickly spread to the whole population, minimizing the relative difference. This is a self-tuning environment: they are competing against themselves, more or less. Again the &quot;Red Queen&quot; factor comes in to play: &quot;running as fast as you can to stay in the same place&quot;...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We might see a few different strategies emerge. Some hunt, some evade, some forage widely, others stay in one spot waiting for food to come to them. Try changing the rules of points scoring, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>gain half the points of the tail you tag</li>
<li>lose your points if you are tagged</li>
</ul>
<p>Try changing the neural network structure</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding/removing layers<ul>
<li>At what point does adding hidden layers seem to have no tangible benefit?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adding/removing nodes etc. <ul>
<li>New sensors and actuators; perhaps sense both nearest head and nearest tail?</li>
<li>Perhaps a &#39;memory&#39; node, that writes an output which becomes an input on the next frame? Perhaps gradually interpolated?</li>
<li>Perhaps a &#39;random&#39; input node?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So far we have replaced entire generations at a time, but of course in the real world creatures&#39; life spans interleave in all kinds of ways, with population booms and busts. Moreover we have rather artificially tested candidates against a pre-defined function, or against the whims of an interacting user or participant. But this isn&#39;t how nature works most of the time. As noted already, <strong>viability-based selection</strong> depends only on fundamental internal processes and exchanges with an environment (including other creatures of various species) to determine whether a creature can survive, and reproduce. So, rather than running in generations, could we try a continuous mode, where as soon as one player is removed from the game, a new player is created at a random position (with mutation from a parent taken from the current population). At this point the fitness measure of scoring points can be removed altogether: players simply need to stay in the game to have a chance of their genes being inherited.</p>

### Energy conservation and global adaptive constraints

Naturally environmentally-based viability selection has also led to models of ecological or ecosystemic basis. A simple starting point may be to take [the agent-based example of variable populations with energy-exchange and preservation](http://codepen.io/grrrwaaa/pen/PZxrbo?editors=0010), and add genetics. In this case viability is principally determined by energy maintenance, so we have to take extra care in modeling this well. Every action an agent takes must cost energy, and this should be proportionate to the action taken. Sprinting takes more energy than sauntering. Locomotion models can estimate energy cost from the force actually applied; which is exactly the acceleration multiplied by the mass. We can approximate this by taking the difference between current & new velocities (after all clamping) and multiplying by the organism size. It may also be wise to have a basic metabolism cost to remain alive, that perhaps may increase with size, and with age.

[Here's a start in this direction](http://codepen.io/grrrwaaa/pen/amgjbb?editors=0010)

As organisms evolve better strategies, they can better utilize the finite energy resources of the world, and thus support greater populations. An adaptive *difficulty*, perhaps applied to the metabolism cost, or applied generally to the available energy in the world, may help keep selection pressure effective at maintaining population size. For example, we can gradually decrease the total energy in the ecosystem while populations are large, and increase it again while populations are small.

Note that exactly how new energy is introduced can have quite drastic effect on the adaptive conditions -- since effectively organisms are trying to evolve strategies to be more viable, the distribution of energy in the world is the primary factor. The simplest option is to reintroduce the energy immediately, spread uniformly over the space, e.g. `field.add(energy_deficit/(field.width*field.height))`. More interesting behaviours can emerge when energy is redistributed more gradually and non-uniformly in space.



### Agent designs

We now have a model of an agent as comprising a collection of sensors, a collection of internal nodes of computing, and a number of output nodes (as actuator potentials) that cause actions in the world:

![agent diagram](img/agent_diagram.png) 

**Possible outputs include:**

- Locomotion. Ideally modeled as signals sent to simulated locomotory systems, rather than simple changes of velocity/orientation. 
- Consumption. Extraction of materials from the environment, e.g. food. 
    - Vice versa, expulsion of materials back into the environment, e.g. building, defecation. 
- Changing internal mental states, such as memory stores, or dispositions.
- Communication. Pheromone deposits, noises, visual signals, etc.
- Growth. Although this is not usually something under an organisms' control for larger organisms, it may be at the cellular level.
- Reproduction. Clearly this is only an internal choice for organisms that reproduce asexually.

> If it is helpful, you may imagine the buttons you can press to control a videogame character. Each button is an output.

It may also be worth asking whether actions can occur concurrently, or whether activating one will suppress others. E.g. can you reproduce while in motion? Can you change direction when not in motion? The simplest technique here is to limit output to one action per frame.

**Possible inputs include:**

- Internal physiological states: At least, the current store of energy (the hungry/satiated axis), but possibly also other internal parametric states if they exist, such as temperature, digestive toxicity, ...
- Smell/taste/pressure/humidity/electroreception/magnetoception: Detection of concentrations/intensities in local fields, at the center location of the agent.
    - Alternatively, sensors on appendages: same as above, but at points removed from the center of the agent according to the bodily position of the sensor. E.g. eyestalks.
- Touch: Detection of collision with objects in the environment. Could be a simple boolean true/false, could include a direction to the collided object, could include a magnitude according to the amount of overlap (i.e. a vector). 
- Proximity/sight/hearing/echolocation: Detection of the number of agents/objects in close range. Could be converted to a loneliness/claustrophobia axis.
    - Or perhaps the center-of-mass of objects/agents in close range (the *cohesion* and *separation* senses of the boids), or some other average property of nearby objects/agents (such as the *alignment* sense of the boids, or perhaps average color of nearby agents). 
    - Could be refined to multiple senses, for different kinds of objects.
- Proprioception/vestibular senses: The sense of motion from within, including balance, poise, etc. The simplest could be an accelerometer, reporting changes of velocity back to the agent. There could also be senses identifying the position or rate of movement of limbs.
- Temporal senses (Chronoception): The simplest being a function of the agent's age since birth.
- Pain (nociception), and perhaps other stimulations, triggered by other activity upon the agent, which dissipates over time.
- Internal mental states, such as memory or dispositions: Could simply be a bank of memory "slots", that are written as one of the action outputs.

It is likely necessary to conform inputs to ranges of sensitivity, such that external quantities are always mapped into internal ranges clamped in a unipolar 0..1 range, or perhaps a bipolar -1..1 range. Outputs may also need to map their intrinsic ranges (unipolar or bipolar) into useful ranges in the world. For example, a unipolar consumption range could be used as a proportion of available food that is actually ingested. Alternatively, it could be mapped to a range determined by the maximum eating rate an organism can sustain (a constant).

For both inputs and outputs, we may need to distinguish between occasional "events" (think of buttons and impacts) and more continuously varying "signals" (think of knobs and rotations), though it is simpler if we do not need to. 

> Event-like inputs can be treated as signals whose value is zero when no event is occurring. Event-like outputs can be treated as signals that pass a given threshold, or change by a significant margin. Thresholding is a general way to convert a signal to an event, possibly with some accumulation & relaxation time, and sampling is a way to convert an event into a signal, possibly with some averaging/smoothing.

**Possible internal operations:**

The middle layers between inputs & outputs may utilize a palette of mathematical mappings and simple signal-processing operators. For example, the set of "neural nodes" available in Karl Sims' [evolving virtual creatures](http://www.karlsims.com/papers/siggraph94.pdf) simulation included:

> sum, product, divide, greater-than, sign-of, min, max, abs, if, interpolate, sin, cos, atan, log, expt, sigmoid, 

Furthermore, a number of more complex "stateful" operators (i.e. operators which include their own history/memory) were included:

> sum-threshold, integrate, differentiate, smooth, oscillate-wave, and oscillate-saw.

Sum-threshold refers to a unit that operates much like a real neuron, accumulating inputs until a threshold is reached, then outputting a pulse and relaxing to zero. That is, neural networks are often modeled using only the sum-threshold (or even simpler, sigmoid) operators. Integrate is a simple counter, but it may be wise to make it "leaky", such that the accumulated value naturally decays over time. Smooth is a simple moving average, or low-pass filter, such as averaging the current and previous input. The oscillators are a combination of a counter with a trigonometric or modulo operation.

Other kinds of internal operations could be structural, such as creating a sequence of actions (and possibly including policies to abort a sequence if an action cannot be completed) or a sequence of options (taking the first one that can be executed). 



Agar:

inputs: size
    3 players, each [angle, distance, size] = 9
    3 foods, each [angle, dist] = 6
TOTAL 16 inputs.
outputs: 2 (angle, speed)

Simplify- remove food, only 2 nearest players
    make perceived 'size' relative to our size (< 0.5 means smaller)
    -> 6 inputs (4 if we remove `distance`)




Target:
inputs: vel dx,dy, target dx,dy, angle & distance to target = 6
outputs: desired direction = 1


Tron:

two players. move in a grid, leaving trail behind. First to enter a wall or trail loses
    - fitness a function of how long you last vs. opponent?

inputs must include: front, L, R states
inputs might include: direction & distance to opponent; additional neighbour states... 

output is forwrd, L, R (use highest)


Snake:

gain points for eating fruits (and snake gets longer)
die when hitting a wall or own tail (like tron)

inputs: neighbouring cells to snake head, angle to fruit (past action?)
actions: turn left, right, or forward
scoring: negative for death, rising positive for being near fruit


tic-tac-toe? 9-in, 9-out (highest valid is selected)


some kind of walker/swimmer type of thing?
a side-scroller variant (avoid collisions)


----

```js 
// derivative of sigmoid (as used for backpropagation):
function dsigmoid(x) { 
    const s = sigmoid(x);     
    return s * (1-s);
}
```

TODO: 

Emphasize:
- importance of enviornment; **niches** (non-triviality)
- requisite variety of envo + bio (non-triviality)
- e.g. nontrivial problem space, non-trivial mappings (development etc.)



- importance of enviornment again: create a system with some kind of physics (like the skeleton mesh stuff, breeding a walker? breeding a car?)
- novelty search
- using D3 or somthign to visualize results
- some way to store results between refreshes
- NEAT here or in another module?
- There's now overlap between this page and the "Code" page, esp. in the turtle graphics part.

Meta-evolution...   [Spector, Lee. "Autoconstructive evolution: Push, pushGP, and pushpop." Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO-2001). Vol. 137. 2001.](http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/pubs/ace.pdf). This is **meta-evolution**: that the mechanisms of evolution (including development, variation, etc.) are also subject to variation and selection. After all, sexual reproduction had to be *discovered*. It turns out that some parts of our genes have evolved to be far less volatile than others, for good reason. Jurgen Schmidhuber also proposed using genetic programming (GP) to evolve GP (meta-GP), since things like chromosomes, crossover etc. are themselves phenomena that have evolved. 

---


### The importance of non-triviality

A good starting point may be to have the genome modify *parameters* of the agent; for example, the amount of random walk, ranges of sensing, the reproduction threshold, thresholds of probability for selecting different actions, etc. Be careful with features like speed -- you might want to model an energetic cost to go with it for realism (and to avoid breeding supersonic agents!). 

Also be careful not to oversimplify. Making a parameter of "energy efficiency" is clearly going to evolve toward maximum efficiency; there's nothing interesting about this. Things get more interesting when there are multiple constraints in play; if increasing one parameter weakens another, for example. 

Similarly, a direct mapping of each gene in the genome to each parameter is likely less interesting than a more complex mapping, in which multiple processes are applied to the genome data to determine the parameters. This is exactly why the evolution of math functions was interesting: the outcome of the math function is a very complex mapping of the genes that go in. Complex enough to have surprises.

Another way of achieving this complexity in the mapping is to have the parameters drive features that have non-obvious effects or that depend on other parameters. For example, one could model a swimming organism by the speed it flaps its tail, the range it flaps over, and the average direction. Only together do these three parameters produce an arc of motion. Multiple such tails can lead to very complex motions. Similarly, taking Braitenberg's vehicles model, one could imagine placing a wire between every sensor and every motor, where the evolved parameters are the amplification weights on the wires.

![sticky feet](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/turk/stickyfeet/zoo_scaled.png)

For example, see [Sticky Feet: Evolution in a Multi-Creature Physical Simulation](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/turk/stickyfeet/index.html) -- including the [video](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/turk/stickyfeet/sticky_feet.mp4). In this example, the genome determines the structure of an organism as a set of point masses connected by springs. The springs are muscle-like in that their rest lengths oscillate, and the point masses also oscillate in their 'stickiness' (environmental friction) in order to support locomotion. Each organism has a heart and a mouth -- if the mouth of one agent touches the heart of another, it can eat it, and is rewarded by reproduction. Organisms may also have antennae attached to a spring segment, which detect either mouths or hearts, and modulate the spring length or stickiness. (A simple 3-segment creature with two sensors can very easily result in similar behaviour to the Braitenberg vehicles.)

#### The Genetic Representation

At this point, should be clear that the effectiveness of evolution depends very much on both the genetic representation as well as its behaviour in producing phenotypes. If we consider the genetic representation as a *language*, then the evolutionary effectiveness depends both on the *syntax* and the *semantics*. 

The syntax determines how a phenotype is encoded, what kinds of mutations are likely/unlikely/impossible, and what transformations these result in, how much space it takes up, the potential of redundancy and neutral data, and so on. 

The semantics define the basic primitive concepts from which phenotypes are produced, and thus what kinds of phenotypes are likely/unlikely/impossible, including the overal size of the set of all possible phenotypes, the resolution of variations between them, and so forth. Put another way: A very common and very general method of solving problems (mathematical, computational, and otherwise), is to translate the problem into a more convenient language. We saw that our agents could reason about neighbours more easily when the neighbour poses where translated out of global space and into the coordinate space of the agent itself. Similarly, the turtle graphics language made it very easy to create simple line drawings, and with just a handful of special tokens quite complex structures, but there are still many shapes this language is unable or very unlikely to express. Simply, some languages work better than others for certain problems. (This may related to the reason why so many species share huge sequences of the same DNA.)

A good genetic representation should consider both syntax and semantics. We don't want to make our intermediate language to too restrictive, else it will not be powerful and extensible enough to encompass a wide enough range of expected and unexpected solutions. For example, we saw how creating an intermediate language of predefined words ensured we have readable (if nonsense) sentences, whereas translating into random numbers and arithmetic symbols opened the possibility of invalid expressions, but also was able to discover unexpected methods (such as using comment symbols for neutral drift). However, we also don't want our intermediate language so powerful and extensible that it becomes inefficient or intractable to actually apply, or upon which evolution has barely a chance to have impact. Our math & turtle graphics examples demonstrated how using a programming language as intermediate representation can achieve great power/diversity with succinct syntax. 

---


## An ecosystemic, evolving agent-environment world

For example, take a look at the agent model here:

[Starter agent model for continuous evolution](http://codepen.io/grrrwaaa/pen/obQrZJ?editors=001)

The agent has a locomotion model based on a two-wheel engine. For movement, the agent has only two output signals -- the rates of turning of each wheel (stored in the property `wheel_rate`, which is a vec2). The `agent_locomotion()` method turns these wheel_rate signals into actual movement. 

The agent also has two external sensors to detect local fields, whose values are computed in the `agent_sensing()` method.

**Energy preservation** is essential to the ecosystemic viability model of selection here. Every action an agent takes must cost energy, and insufficient energy must result in death.

- The locomotion model incorporates this in terms of the force actually applied (i.e. the acceleration -- as difference between the current and new velocities -- multiplied by the mass).
- There is also a fixed mass-dependent metabolism cost, applied on each frame regardless whether the agent is moving.
- There is also a digestion cost, modeled simply as a certain portion of consumed food's energy being lost.

Inevitably this means that over time, energy is being lost from the world. We can calculate how much energy is active in the system by adding up the total in each field cell (by `field.sum()`) as well as the energy stored in each agent. When this total energy level drops below our chosen carrying capacity for the world, we can then introduce energy back in, to ensure that the whole system doesn't wind down to zero. Exactly how this energy is re-introduced can have quite drastic effect on the adaptive conditions -- since effectively organisms are trying to evolve strategies to be more viable, the distribution of energy in the world is the primary factor. The simplest option is to reintroduce the energy immediately, spread uniformly over the space, e.g. `field.add(energy_deficit/(field.width*field.height))`. More interesting behaviours can emerge when energy is redistributed more gradually and non-uniformly in space.

The population can shrink and grow (safely, because the main update loop iterates backwards). Still, **population control** is also essential at both ends. Clearly if the population ever drops to zero, we will never see any organisms again. Methods to overcome this include preventing death, or introducing new randomly seeded organisms (perhaps out of view) at low population sizes, as well as adaptively varying the reproduction cost/threshold. At the other end, a population that grows excessively large can slow down the simulation, perhaps even crash it. In theory the conservation of energy can prevent this, but in practice a hard limit may also be necessary. 

As organisms evolve better strategies, they can better utilize the finite energy resources of the world, and thus support greater populations. An adaptive *difficulty*, perhaps applied to the metabolism cost, or applied generally to the available energy in the world, may help keep selection pressure effective at maintaining population size. For example, we can gradually decrease the total energy in the ecosystem while populations are large, and increase it again while populations are small.

## Genetic Programming

Our math & turtle graphics examples demonstrated how using a programming language as intermediate representation can achieve great power/diversity with succinct syntax. We'll explore that in more detail via *genetic programming*. 

Genetic Programming was invented by Nigel Cramer in 1985, but greatly expanded through the work of John Koza. GP evolves programs; it is an example of **metaprogramming**. GP has been used to generate programs to solve hard problems, and to evolve control systems for artificial agents and robots. Karl Sims used GP for his genetic images as well as for his evolving virtual creatures. 

In GP that the generating a phenotype is a process of generating *programs*, however programs are usually expressed as syntax *trees* rather than as lines of code. The leaves of the tree are *terminals*, while the non-terminal branches are *functions*. Terminals have no inputs; typical terminals are constant numbers and external/global variable names, but this set can also include zero-argument functions such as "random()" or context-sensing such as "get_orientation()". Non-terminal functions are specified according to their operator (such as mathematical addition, multiplication, cosine, etc.); they have one or more inputs (the number of inputs is the *arity*), which may be filled by terminals or other functions. The set of all possible terminals and non-terminal functions constitutes the *primitive set* of a GP system (a union of the *terminal set* and the *function set*). 

This structure is natural to LISP programs:

```lisp
(* (sin (+ x 2)) (cos x))
```

In this case, the terminal set appears to include integers and "x", the function set includes "sin", "cos", and binary operators such as "+", and "*". 

Javascript does not have this representational succinctness, but can get close to it by nested arrays:

```javascript
["*", ["sin", ["+", "x", 2]], ["cos", "x"]]
```

Or more graphically:

```javascript
[
    "*", 
    [
        "sin", 
        [
            "+", 
            "x", 
            2]
    ], 
    [
        "cos", 
        "x"
    ]
]
```

Note that our representation is more brittle than a simple string of symbols: any array beginning with "sin" must have one more element following it as the argument; any array beginning with "+" must have two elements (array length 3) following it as arguments. Moreover, those arguments must either be *terminal* nodes such as "x" or numbers, or they must be arrays -- that is, operator symbols like "sin" and "+" can only occupy the first position. Since we know that our operators require *at most* two arguments, we could simply give all functions two arguments, and ignore the un-used ones as neutral junk genetic data, e.g.:

```javascript
[
    "*", 
    [
        "sin", 
        [
            "+", 
            "x", 
            2], 
        5        // junk
    ], 
    [
        "cos", 
        "x", 
        "x"        // junk
    ]
]
```

### Interpretation (development)

To turn this *data* into something we can actually run as *code*, we could spell it out as an expression:

```javascript
return (Math.sin(x + 2) * Math.cos(x));
```

Here's a recursive solution:

```javascript
function develop(node) {
    // terminals:
    if (typeof node == "string" || typeof node == "number") {
        return node;
    }
    // non-terminals:
    let op = node[0];
    let a = node[1];
    let b = node[2];
    if (op == "sin" || op == "cos") {
        // unary Math function call:
        return "Math." + op + "(" + develop(a) + ")";
    } else if (op == "+" || op == "*" || op == "-" || op == "/" || op == "%") {
        // binary operator:
        return "(" + develop(a) + op + develop(b) + ")";
    }
}
```

### Choice of primitive set

A couple of things to watch out for here: 

- It is assumed that all functions return one value
- It is assumed that returned values are of a type that can be used in other functions. This gets trickier when introducing conditional functions (e.g. `(if x y)`), since numeric values need to be converted to booleans. More complex systems may introduce type metadata into the tree.
- Functions should not throw errors or cause invalid behaviour, so often "protected" versions of operations are used. For example, divide (or modulo) by zero may be detected and avoided, reducing the number of run-time exceptions to trap.
- There should be enough scope in the primitive set to generate satisfactory solutions to the problem

### Seed generation

To generate a random seed genotype, we can also use a recursive procedure. **One thing to watch out for: we need to make sure we don't spawn infinitely large genotypes!** To do that, we'll need to pass some information through the recursion to bail out at a certain depth, or when the genome has a certain size. For example, we could limit the recursive depth as follows:

```javascript
let ops = ["sin", "cos", "+", "-", "*", "/", "%"];

function pick_random_operator() {
    return ops[random(ops.length)];
}
function make_random_terminal() {
    return random(2) ? "time" : Math.random()*1000;
}

function generate(depth) {
    // forces use of terminal when depth == 1, randomized otherwise:
    if (random(depth) == 0) {
        return make_random_terminal();
    } else {
        return [
            pick_random_operator(), 
            generate(depth-1), 
            generate(depth-1)
        ];
    }
}

// generate with maximum depth 6:
var data = generate(6);

// print out nicely:
console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, " "));
```

Koza also recommends creating a seed population with a variety of depths, which we can easily do by randomizing the initial argument to `generate()`. 


### Mutations and recombinations

GP departs significantly from other evolutionary algorithms in the implementation of mutation and recombination. It is not just individual terminal symbols that can be mutated, but also entire branches. 
Extra care has to be taken here to prune genomes that are getting too large (or to avoid then getting too small!). Some possible mutations include:

- Replace a terminal with another random terminal. A good variation of this is to offset a constant terminal by a small amount.
- Replace the operator name of a function
- Replace a random function with a terminal
- Swap the argument order of a function
- Replace a function with a copy of another function within the same genome (including all subtrees)
- Replace entire genome with one of its subtrees. (This will make it smaller).
- Replace a function with a randomly-generated function (including subtrees). We may introduce a condition to make sure the replacement has a similar size as the item replaced.
- In sexual reproduction, the most common variant is *sub-tree crossover*: Parent A is cloned, but a random subtree is chosen to be replaced with another randomly-chosen subtree from Parent B. Typically sexual cross-over is utilized more when populations number in the hundreds, thousands or more, whereas mutation is more widely utilized in smaller populations.

A tricky point -- most of these mutations depend on choosing a random non-terminal. How can we pick one randomly? And how can we ensure that the genomes stay of a reasonable size? The solutions to these problems are not trivial enough to work through in our labs.


### Alternative representations

Many GP systems today assume that all non-terminal functions have the same arity (the same no. of arguments). By doing so, it turns out that the brackets become redundant, and trees can efficiently be represented as simple linear sequences. The above example can be simply listed as:

```js
* sin + x 2 5 cos x x
```

Clearly this makes some mutations easier -- we can pick random items in the list and replace them with equivalents, e.g. replacing terminals with terminals, operators with operators. We can easily see the genome size, and use that as a selection factor. But it is still not so trivial to make replacements and ensure the whole genome still generates a complete program.

Another variant, called "linear genetic programming", also uses a flat list of nodes, but in a format closer to a register language (in fact, closer to the underlying architecture of modern PCs). Each node in this list has an operator, to determine what kind of instruction it is (e.g. "+", "sin", "var", etc.), followed by some values to specify which existing "registers", that is, previously-computed values, are to be used as arguments to the operation. Each operation will then produce a new register in turn. So, the code generated will look something like this:

```javascript
var r1 = x;
var r2 = 2;
var r3 = r1 + r2;
var r4 = Math.sin(r3);
var r5 = x;
var r6 = Math.cos(r5);
var r7 = r4 * r6;
return r7;
```

A genetic representation might be something like this:

```js
[
    [ "var", "x" ],
    [ "num", 2 ],
    [ "+", 1, 0 ],
    [ "sin", 0 ],
    [ "var", "x" ],
    [ "cos", 0 ],
    [ "*", 2, 0 ],
]
```

Notice how registers are stored as offsets back from the currently-assigning register. So, an argument of `0` means the last-computed-register, `1` means the one computed before that, etc. This kind of relative indexing makes the representation far more robust -- less likely to be malformed after mutation. Even greater safety can be ensured by wrapping register indices within the available range. For a linearized genotype representation, the genetic mutations and crossover operators are similar to other sequence-based evolutionary systems.

Yet another very different but related approach is **gramatical evolution**. In GE, genomes are simply lists of integers, for example in the range 0-99. The possible shape of programs is determined by a grammar. The generator follows each rule of the grammar in turn, and when multiple options are possible, the next genome integer is used to determine the choice (modulo the number of choices). This not only guarantees that all generated programs are formally correct (no matter how complex the grammar involved), it also seems to lend some advantages with respect to mutations. Grammatical evolution has been very successful and is widely used.

### Subtleties and misconceptions

Darwin's theory is sometimes misconceived as "survival of the fittest" or even the competitive "law of the jungle", but evolution turns out to be quite a bit more subtle than this.

- First, *the notion of "fittest" is misleading*. It implies a static and absolute measure against which all individuals and species in the biological record can be compared. In natural evolution **there can be no pre-defined fitness measure**. This is because the environmental conditions are highly dynamic, and thus selective criteria are quite contextual. The conditions in which we live evolve along with us, and the other species in our habitat, as we mutually influence each other. Evolution is an open-ended process. 
  - This also means that there's **no single best solution**. The complication of living in an ever-changing environment means that **no one strategy can be universally superior**. This is sometimes referred to as the "no free lunch" theorem, which is more accurately stated that "if an algorithm performs well on a certain class of problems then it necessarily pays for that with degraded performance on the set of all remaining problems." (Wolpert, D.H., Macready, W.G. (1997), "No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization", IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation 1, 67.)
  - Since there is no absolute goal or progress, the most we can measure in natural evolution is the changing frequencies over time of individual species, or of individual characteristics of a population. More importantly, **natural evolution cannot be said to have a singular direction**. That is to say, it is goal-less (*non-teleological*), and thus *natural evolution does not imply progress*. 

- Evolution does not imply a continuous process of change. The fossil records appear to show long periods of relative stability divided by relatively brief periods of biological invention. There are several competing theories as to why this is, but interestingly this "*punctuated equilibrium*" has appeared also in many artificial evolutionary systems.

- An individual organism does not need to be optimally fit to the environment in order to contribute to the gene pool -- it simply needs to be *fit enough* to reproduce, i.e. to be *viable*. A natural species depends only on the **viability** of enough individuals to reproduce within an unpredictable environment. 
  - Thus, natural selection does not act on every facet of an organism, but only those that directly influence viability in the current environment. If a variation has neither positive or negative impact on the reproductive capability, this variation is called **neutral**. It is quite possible that variations due to **selective forces** are weaker than **neutral variations**. 
  - Since small variations are always occurring, neutral variations can tend to accumulate and diversify over time. This may broaden the gene pool or even move it quite far from its origin, without causing any major changes in selective viability; this is called **neutral drift**. This may be an important mechanism to escape evolutionary dead-ends (local minima in the fitness landscape). This is certainly true for many artificial evolutionary systems. It has also been hypothesized as an explanation for the long chunks of apparently unused DNA in our own genome, and for punctuated equilibrium.

- Competition turns out not to be the prime mode of interaction between species; most species seem to have evolved to be relatively independent of each other, and the ones that do closely interact are **more likely to be collaborative than competitive**, through symbiosis or other means, as that is more likely to lead to viability. Evolution does not imply that individuals display selfish behavior. 
  - Nevertheless, there is a sense in which competition applies, as with [red queen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen_hypothesis) hypothesis: that organisms must constantly adapt, evolve, and proliferate not merely to gain advantage in reproductive viability, but also simply to survive while pitted against an ever-evolving context. It is not yet clear whether a simple "arms race" is a sufficient perspective, or whether more complex and even abiotic factors may be more significant.

- To support diversity, an environment must be complex enough to provide multiple methods of making a living (**evolutionary "niches"**). There is a cybernetic theory that, for life to take advantage of the variety of niches present in an environment, and the variety of problems to overcome, life must have a corresponding **requisite variety** with which to adapt; that is, sufficient potential diversity.  
   - **Evolution alone is not creative**, and its importance may have been over-stated. The theory of natural selection does not account for how novel diversity and new characteristics arise; it merely requires that such a mechanism exists, which usually is assumed to operate primarily during reproduction.
