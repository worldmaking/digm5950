<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> This course addresses computation as a creative medium from a biologically-inspired standpoint to develop artworks, adaptive media and simulations approaching the fascinating complexity of nature.</p>

<p>Artists, composers, designers and architects have always drawn inspiration from nature. In this course we do so by translating <em>mechanisms inspired by biology</em> (or theories of biology) into digital/computational media. That is, using bio-inspired computational techniques to leverage or approach the creative capacities of nature. </p>
<p>The course has a strongly practical emphasis, exploring frameworks through applications implemented both in-class and through student projects. Frameworks explored in the course may include complex dynamical systems, fractals, cellular automata, agent-based systems, evolutionary and developmental programming, artificial chemistries and ecosystems. These are critically examined by interweaving the history, theory and landmark works in the literature of generative art, evolutionary music and art, and process art, as well as artificial life, systems biology, and bioinformatics research, and philosophies of process, creativity, and the aesthetics of nature. </p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Autonomous complexity is one of the fundamental hallmarks of computational art; an integral message of the medium. Biologically-inspired methods of digital media formation have found wide applications in art, film, music, video games, robotics, and other computationally-facilitated experiences, frequently drawing upon scientific models of pattern formation, system dynamics, and symbol processing in large populations. Art has always been deeply concerned with its relationship to nature, though the forms of the relationship have changed many times. Likewise, from its origins computing has also found biological inspiration in pattern formation, self-construction and reproduction, intelligence, autonomy and collective behaviour. This course understands such developments from their arts and science foundations in both theory and practice.</p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>In 2020 this course will be remotely delivered in a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous learning. Lectures and lab practice sessions will be held every Monday morning via Zoom. Lectures focus on the introduction of theoretical, aesthetic and conceptual content of the course. Labs focus on the application of lecture material in the form of instructor-led reconstructions, excercises/studies, and larger projects.</p>
<p>All Zoom sesions will be recorded and posted online using MS Teams. </p>
<p><strong>Learning outcomes / objectives:</strong> At the completion of the course students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show strong grounding in multiple methodologies of bio-inspired computation, including demonstrating understanding of mathematical, theoretical as well as aesthetic aspects. </li>
<li>Be able to apply methodologies effectively in creative practice to a diversity of digital and interactive media, as evidenced in a project portfolio.</li>
<li>Be able to interpret and reflect critically on a variety of adaptive and generative media.</li>
<li>Leverage experience in the application of cutting-edge creative coding in generative and interactive arts in order to intelligently extrapolate into future culture technologies.</li>
<li>Have refined advanced coding skills.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="assignments.html">Assignments: 40%</a>. Exercises will assigned throughout the course. Exercises develop essential practice-informed critique and experiential learning. For each assessed exercise you will be asked to submit your code. Be sure to read &amp; follow the instructions below regarding formatting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assignment videos -- for one assignment only (you can choose which): 20% (undergraduate students only). In addition please self-record a video that shows your desktop screen and captures your voice explaining your work. (In previous years we had students present their work to the group, but with the class size being so large we can&#39;t really afford the time to do this; hence videos.) These videos can be around 3 minutes each. The video should show the work and the code, and while recording your screen, please record your voice talking through the work. <ul>
<li>Talk about your initial ideas and inspiration. Was there a core question you wanted to address? Did you have an idea that you wanted to evaluate? </li>
<li>Explain in depth your implementation. <ul>
<li>Be sure to focus on the most complex, innovative, or otherwise interesting parts of the code, beyond what we cover in class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evaluate the result. Are there significant variable changes that can produce different behaviour (if so, show them!) Did you try several variations of your system (if so, show them!)  If you had an idea that you explored, but it didn&#39;t work as expected, show that too -- and offer your ideas about why you think it didn&#39;t. This is valid research! Talk about what you might do next.</li>
<li>You can record a video using Zoom, Quicktime, OBS, or several other options. Recording with a cellphone is not acceptable.  If you are having difficulties with screen recording, we can schedule a session in-class to do this live instead.</li>
<li>Submit via the <strong>Assignments</strong> tab in <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aef5cfda6bcf0493e8ecae3b0e05d163f%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=2286cd4d-8394-4a66-9c74-0d27ffd875b1&amp;tenantId=34531318-7011-4fd4-87f0-a43816c49bd0">Teams</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Final Project: 30%. Realized individually or in groups, demonstrate the effective application of understanding through the course in novel expressions of adaptive media and art. Projects will be presented to the class at the end of the term and will be in the form of a critical discussion that reflects on the results of the experience gained over duration of the course.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Final project report: 20% (graduate students only). </p>
<ul>
<li>Please prepare a written report (2-4 pages) on your project, including significant references (citations and/or related works), with appropriate scholarly quality to be considered as a submission to an academic conference such as <a href="http://evostar.dei.uc.pt/2012/">EvoMusArt</a>, ISEA, GA, ECAL, IEEE ALIFE, IEEE CEC, GECCO, ALEA, EA. etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Readings and participation: 10%. Readings are short selections from books or landmark papers, chosen to directly support the assignments and tutorial discussion. Participation incorporates contributions to tutorial discussions, awareness of issues in readings, and the ability to relate tutorial issues to the broader concerns of the course.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="labs">Labs</h2>
<p>The examples we will work though in class, and for assignments, will use the JavaScript programming language, embedded in web browsers. To make this easier, I have prepared a starter template and library in Codepen.io&#39;s online editor.  This starter-kit will be used in all labs. <a href="labs.html">The features provided by this kit are documented here</a></p>
